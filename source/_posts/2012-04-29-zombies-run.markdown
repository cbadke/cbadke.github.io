I ran the first mission from Zombies, Run! and I absolutely loved it!

If you want to do some running but you’re tired of worrying about pacing,
distance, time etc give this game a try. You pop in your headphones, tie on
your shoes and don’t get caught! The game guides you through a story and from
time to time zombie hordes show up to eat you and force you to sprint. It’s a
slick little hook to do sprint/interval training and it’s a blast!
