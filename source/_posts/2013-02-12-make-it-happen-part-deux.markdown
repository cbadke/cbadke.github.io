You are good enough.

After writing my previous post I kept thinking about the reasons people hold
back from going after their goals and aspirations. Then I saw this:

[![If you care about what you do, its hard not to feel inadequate. @bjeanes](/images/blog/2013-02-12/tweet.png)](https://twitter.com/bjeanes/status/300827620411584512)

And the very next morning a friend of mine posted this:

[![Failure can destroy you or make you work harder.](/images/blog/2013-02-12/failure.jpg)](https://twitter.com/RealScottWeller/status/300929213186334721/photo/1)

Of course! Fear! Fear of inadequacy, of failure, of embarrassment. Fear can be
a paralyzing force for many people.

Well, have I got news for you! **You are good enough!**

Want to contribute to an open source project? Do it! Your help will be
appreciated! The other developers will help guide you and teach you how to
improve. And odds are, you will teach everyone else something new too!

Want that new position at work? Do it! Prove yourself!

Will you fail? Probably at some point. But you will learn and you will grow.

There is no secret quality that the people you admire have that you lack. They
work hard, they keep trying and they chase their passion. These are all things
you can do too!

So get out there! Take one step at a time. Make it happen!
