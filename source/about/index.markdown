I am a software developer at DevFacto Technologies\* in Edmonton, AB.

I am interested in software design, software languages and human behaviour. How does one design software to be easily testable? How should a team execute a project to improve the odds of success? How can communities by built and shaped? I enjoy discussing these types of questions.

There is a high probability of ‘rum driven writing’. Please take all posts with the appropriate level of salt.
