    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a C# developer, go try out NCrunch for your continuous testing.</p>

<p>NCrunch will automatically run your test suite as you modify your files. You
don’t have to take the time to run your tests as you do your TDD
red-green-refactor steps, the tests just keep running.</p>

<p>The visual feedback of what lines are covered by tests and what lines are
involved in passing/failing tests give you immediate feedback as you work
without a lot of looking around for test results. Mark also made the
observation that the black dots remind you to flesh out your testing because
they constantly taunt you that you are writing untested code.</p>

<p>There may be some trouble with NCrunch in conjuction with Nugets new automatic
retrieval mechanism that was released recently. I haven’t tried it out yet but
it sound like there might be something to watch out for there.</p>

<p>Go use it!</p>
